# README

The inventory directory includes the raw and processed data from the seven study sites.   

## Each file is named after the main site name:

**LONGLEAT.xlsx** includes the data for Longleat1 (L1), which is included in Chapter 3, and Longleat2 (L2), which is a study site of Chapter 4.  
**STOURHEAD.xlsx** includes the data for Stourhead1 (S1), which is included in Chapter 3, and Stourhead2 (S2), which is a study site of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.  
**BAGLEY WOOD.xlsx** includes the data for Bagley Wood (BW), which is included in Chapter 3.  
**MORTIMER.xlsx** includes the data for Mortimer (M), which is included in Chapter 4.  
**RINGWOOD.xlsx** includes the data for Ringwood (R), which is included in Chapter 4.  

## Each file contains seven tabs:  

**TREE PLOT**: 
Raw inventory data collected from the trees found in the tree plots.  
Includes the following columns:  
*STAND*: stand name, *ID*: individual name, *Plot*: plot number, *Species*: individual species, *Dbh_cm*: diameter at breast height in cm and *Ht_m*: height measured in metres. 

**REGEN PLOT**: 
Raw inventory data collected from the seedlings and saplings found within the natural regeneration plots.  
Includes the following columns:  
*STAND*: stand name, *Plot*: plot number, *Species*: individual species, *Dbh_cm*: diameter at breast height in cm and *Ht_m*: height measured in metres. 

**SHRUB PLOT**: 
Raw inventory data collected from the shrubs found within the natural regeneration plots.  
Includes the following columns:  
*STAND*: stand name, *Plot*: plot number, *Species*: individual species, *%_Cover	avg*: Proportion of ground covered by the shrub species and *Ht_m*: average height measured in metres. 

**PLOT**
Summary of each plot characteristics and raw data collected per plot (canopy density and basal area).  
Includes the following columns:  
*STAND*: stand name, *DATE*: when the inventory took place,	*PLOT ID*: plot number,	*WP*: waypoint of the center of each plot, *tree_radious_m*: size of the tree plot in metres,	*regen_shrub_radious_m*: size of the natural regeneration and shrub plot in metres,	*num_Snag*: number of dead trees standing, *num_Downed_Log*: number of dead trees on the ground, *BFA used (n)*: Biterlich relascope scale used to estimate the basal area,	*trees counted (z)*: number of trees counted under the BFA scale,	*G (m2/ha)*: basal area estimated, *CDn*: number of points counted with the densiometre, *CD not occupied*: percentage of not cover sky, *CD occupied*: percentage of sky covered by tree canopy.
